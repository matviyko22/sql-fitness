## App Overview

The Health and Fitness Tracking App is a comprehensive tool designed to help users monitor and improve their health and fitness levels. The primary objectives of the app are to:

1. Provide a platform for users to log and track their health metrics.
2. Offer personalized fitness recommendations based on user data.
3. Help users monitor their nutrition intake, including calories and macronutrients.
4. Record and analyze sleep patterns to improve rest and recovery. 
5. Promote wellbeing through meditation and breathing practices, focusing not only on physical but also mental health.

The target audience for this app is broad, encompassing anyone interested in improving their health and fitness. This could range from beginners just starting their fitness journey to seasoned athletes looking for a tool to optimize their training and recovery. The app is possible to personalize for each user, allowing them to set their own goals and track their progress over time.

The specific health and fitness metrics the app will track include:

1. Workout Data: This includes the type of workout (e.g., running, weightlifting), duration, intensity, and calories burned.
2. Nutrition Data: This includes daily calorie intake, macronutrients (proteins, carbs, fats), and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).
3. Sleep Data: This includes total sleep time, sleep stages (light, deep, REM), and sleep quality. To get the data, the app will be available to integrate with a smartwatch like Garmin or a targeted sleep tracker like Oura Ring.
4. Wellbeing Data: This includes data from meditation and breathing practices, such as duration and frequency. The app will be available to integrate with a meditation app like Headspace or Calm, while also offering its own guided meditation and breathing practices.
5. Health Metrics: This includes weight, body fat percentage, heart rate, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics. The app will take into account the context and health history of each user to sensibly interpret the data.

The app will benefit users in achieving their fitness goals and maintaining a healthy lifestyle by providing a comprehensive overview of their health and fitness data. By tracking this data over time, users can identify trends, monitor progress, and make informed decisions about their health and fitness routines. The personalized fitness recommendations will also help users optimize their workouts and nutrition for their specific goals and needs.

## Data Requirements

The key data elements that the app needs to store and manage include are:

1. User Data: This includes personal information such as name, age, gender, weight, height, and fitness goals. This data is crucial for personalizing the app experience and tailoring fitness recommendations.

2. Workout Data: This includes the type of workout, duration, intensity, and calories burned. For example, a user might log a 30-minute run at a moderate intensity that burned 300 calories. This data is important for tracking progress towards fitness goals.

3. Nutrition Data: This includes daily calorie intake and breakdown of macronutrients and micronutrients. For instance, a user might log a meal that contained 500 calories, 20g of protein, 50g of carbohydrates, and 15g of fat. This data is essential for ensuring users are fueling their bodies properly for their workouts and overall health.

4. Sleep Data: This includes total sleep time and sleep stages. For example, a user might log 8 hours of sleep, including 2 hours of deep sleep, 5 hours of light sleep, and 1 hour of REM sleep. This data is crucial for understanding recovery and rest, which are key components of fitness.

5. Wellbeing Data: This includes data from meditation and breathing practices, such as duration and frequency. For instance, a user might log a 15-minute meditation session. This data is important for tracking mental health and stress levels, which can impact physical health and fitness.

6. Health Metrics: This includes metrics like body fat percentage, heart rate, and blood pressure. For example, a user might log a resting heart rate of 60 beats per minute. This data is important for monitoring overall health and detecting potential health issues.

In terms of relationships between different data elements, all workout, nutrition, sleep, wellbeing, and health metrics data are related to the user data. Each user will have multiple entries for these data elements over time, creating a one-to-many relationship. For example, one user might have multiple workout logs, nutrition logs, sleep logs, etc.

Capturing these data points is crucial for the success of the application as it allows for a comprehensive overview of a user's health and fitness. By tracking these metrics over time, users can monitor their progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions about their health and fitness routines. The data also enables the app to provide personalized fitness recommendations based on the user's unique data and goals.

## SQL Schema Starter

We'll need several tables to store the different types of data:

1. Users: This table will store user data. Each user will have a unique user_id (primary key), along with other attributes like name, age, gender, weight, height, and fitness_goals.

2. Workouts: This table will store workout data. Each workout will have a unique workout_id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing Users), workout_type, duration, intensity, and calories_burned.

3. Nutrition: This table will store nutrition data. Each entry will have a unique nutrition_id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing Users), calorie_intake, protein, carbs, fats, and micronutrients.

4. Sleep: This table will store sleep data. Each entry will have a unique sleep_id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing Users), total_sleep_time, light_sleep, deep_sleep, and REM_sleep.

5. Wellbeing: This table will store wellbeing data. Each entry will have a unique wellbeing_id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing Users), meditation_duration, and breathing_practice_frequency.

6. HealthMetrics: This table will store health metrics data. Each entry will have a unique health_metric_id (primary key), user_id (foreign key referencing Users), body_fat_percentage, heart_rate, and blood_pressure.

The user_id in the Users table is the primary key that uniquely identifies each user. This user_id is then used as a foreign key in the other tables to establish a relationship between the user and their workout, nutrition, sleep, wellbeing, and health metrics data. This is a one-to-many relationship because one user can have multiple entries in these tables.

This schema aligns with the application's objectives because it allows for the storage and management of all the necessary data elements. It enables users to log and track their health metrics, monitor their nutrition, record their sleep patterns, and track their wellbeing practices. It also allows for the provision of personalized fitness recommendations based on the user's unique data and goals.
